Install Monaco Font on Ubuntu

Inspired by http://jorrel.blogspot.it/2007/11/monaco-on-ubuntu.html

```bash
curl -kL https://raw.github.com/jiyinyiyong/monaco-font/master/install-font.sh | bash
```

I found that Monaco looks like in pixels on my laptop,  
so I posted to Chinese Arch forum for help,  
https://bbs.archlinuxcn.org/viewtopic.php?id=1346  
Then I received a modified version of Monaco which looks better when it's small.  

Hope it helps ;)
